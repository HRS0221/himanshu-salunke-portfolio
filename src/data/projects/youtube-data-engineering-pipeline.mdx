# ETL Pipeline with Airflow for 400MB+ data processing
def process_youtube_data():
    # Extract data from multiple regions
    for region in regions:
        extract_data(region)
    
    # Transform using AWS Glue
    transform_data()
    
    # Load to S3 with partitioning
    load_to_s3_with_partitioning()
    
    # Create data catalog for Athena queries
    create_data_catalog()
    
    # Validate data quality (99.9% success rate)
    validate_data_quality()
```

### Data Quality Monitoring
```python
# Automated data quality checks for 99.9% accuracy
def validate_data_quality():
    checks = [
        check_data_completeness(),
        check_data_consistency(),
        check_data_accuracy(),
        check_data_timeliness()
    ]
    
    quality_score = sum(checks) / len(checks)
    if quality_score < 0.99:  # 99% threshold
        trigger_data_reprocessing()
    
    return quality_score
```
