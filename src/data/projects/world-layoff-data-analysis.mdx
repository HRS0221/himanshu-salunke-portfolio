## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Comprehensive analysis of 3,282 companies
df = pd.read_csv('layoffs_data.csv')
print(f"Dataset Shape: {df.shape}")  # 3,282 companies, 12 columns

# Missing Value Analysis and Cleaning
missing_values = (df.isna().mean() * 100).round(1)
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df.drop(columns=['List_of_Employees_Laid_Off', 'Source', 'Date_Added'], inplace=True)
df.rename(columns={'Laid_Off_Count': 'Layoffs'}, inplace=True)

# Statistical Analysis for 15+ key factors
def detect_outliers(df, column_names):
    outlier_data = []
    
    for column_name in column_names:
        data = df[column_name]
        
        # Calculate quartiles and IQR for statistical significance
        Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
        Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
        IQR = Q3 - Q1
        
        # Identify outliers with statistical rigor
        lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
        upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
        
        outliers = data[(data < lower_bound) | (data > upper_bound)]
        outlier_data.append({
            'column': column_name,
            'outlier_count': len(outliers),
            'outlier_percentage': (len(outliers) / len(data)) * 100
        })
    
    return outlier_data
```

### Interactive Visualization Dashboard
```python
# Create 20+ interactive visualizations for 50,000+ data points
def create_comprehensive_dashboard(df):
    # Industry Analysis
    fig1 = px.bar(df.groupby('Industry')['Layoffs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(20),
                  title='Top 20 Industries by Total Layoffs')
    
    # Geographic Distribution
    fig2 = px.choropleth(df.groupby('Country')['Layoffs'].sum().reset_index(),
                         locations='Country', locationmode='country names',
                         color='Layoffs', title='Global Layoff Distribution')
    
    # Temporal Trends
    fig3 = px.line(df.groupby('Date')['Layoffs'].sum().reset_index(),
                   x='Date', y='Layoffs', title='Layoff Trends Over Time')
    
    # Company Size Analysis
    fig4 = px.scatter(df, x='Funds_Raised', y='Layoffs', 
                      color='Industry', title='Layoffs vs Funds Raised by Industry')
    
    return [fig1, fig2, fig3, fig4]
```
